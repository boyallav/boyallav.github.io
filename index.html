  <p1>The application is primarily concerned with patient health, and a patient can use it by setting up login credentials. Once the patient has access to the app, he must enter the disease symptoms for which he needs the main treatment in order to receive it. In order to receive further treatment, a patient must make an appointment with a doctor. The doctor will then recommend a diagnosis before beginning treatment. As soon as the doctor receives the findings for the diagnosis, he prescribes drugs to treat the illness. The patient does not need to schedule a new appointment if he or she wants to see the doctor again. In conclusion, this application is user-friendly for basic medical care.</p1>
