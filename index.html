<h1> VENKATA SIVA BOYALLA </h1>
<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
<p1>
    <p1> For building our project we require Java, React native.</p1>
    <h2> METHOD/APPROACH: </h2>
    <p1> For developing this project, firstly we would collect the data of several diseases, diagnoise the diseases, collect the data for basic medication , linking the data collected for basic medication and diagnosis of disease. Later on we would collect the data of doctors belonging to any particular hospital and according to their specialization, we would inter link them with the set of diseases, so that the user can connect directly to a specialized doctor (if he is not satisfied with basic medication). At the end for building the application we will be using react native.</p1>
